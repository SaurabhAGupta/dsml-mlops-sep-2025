# MLOps Best Coding Practices
<!--Adding some random sentence from the V1 branch.-->

## Version Control
- Use Git for code, data, and model versioning
- Implement branching strategies (GitFlow, GitHub Flow)
- Tag releases and maintain semantic versioning
- Track data lineage and model provenance

## Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Use linting tools (flake8, pylint, black)
- Implement code reviews and pull request workflows

## Environment Management
- Use Docker containers for reproducible environments
- Pin dependency versions in requirements.txt/poetry.lock
- Separate development, staging, and production environments
- Use virtual environments or conda environments

## Configuration Management
- Store configurations in separate files (YAML, JSON)
- Use environment variables for secrets and parameters
- Implement configuration validation
- Version control configuration files

## Data Management
- Implement data validation and schema checking
- Use data versioning tools (DVC, MLflow)
- Establish data pipelines with proper error handling
- Monitor data drift and quality metrics

## Model Development
- Use experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases)
- Implement model validation and testing
- Create reproducible training pipelines
- Document model assumptions and limitations

## CI/CD Pipelines
- Automate testing, building, and deployment
- Implement model performance monitoring
- Use automated model retraining triggers
- Maintain rollback capabilities

## Monitoring & Observability
- Log model predictions and performance metrics
- Implement alerting for model degradation
- Monitor infrastructure and resource usage
- Track business metrics and KPIs
